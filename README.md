# aircraft_wing_structure

Project developed in Aircraft structural elements
design course taken in University of Sao Paulo

The goal is to simulate a wing box in finite elements method 
and to calculate the safety factor for the composite material
using as failure criteria: maximum stress, maximum strain, Tsai-Hill
and Tsai-Wu
